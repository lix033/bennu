Once downloaded, open the shipment 1/2/3 folder in the VsCode code editor.
Make sure you have downloaded the live server extension to ensure proper operation;
To start the server and view the rendering, you have two choices :
Press the ALT+L+O key combination (a browser window will open for viewing)
Press the Go Live button at the bottom of your VsCode editor (a browser window will open for viewing).

NB: the shipment-1 & 2 JSON files contain errors: instead of Status, it says satus, but the Json file contains no errors.
As for the design you provided, I had trouble reproducing it, but I think mine meets your expectations.
Thank you for your help.
les dossier Shipment-2 et 3 se trouves dans les branches respectives Shipment2 et shipment3
